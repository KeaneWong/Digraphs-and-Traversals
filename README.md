# Graphs-and-Traversals
Adjacency list based graphs built to handle graphs represented with names, associated string codes for nodes, and relative weight values for edges. Main function contains an example test driver that takes in a list of flights, a list of airports, and associated information from two input files line by line. Ultimately places the processed information into an output text file or prints Dijkstra path traversals to console.
First two inputs in the test driver are the filename or file path, and subsequent inputs are used to test the functions. Full description found in header file of the class
Graph deals with string representations, with a string based code, string based names, and associated directed edges with a strong code and weight value associated with it.
